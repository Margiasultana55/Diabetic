                        <h2>Coffee</h2>
                        There’s a study suggesting that increasing your coffee (caffeinated and decaffeinated)
                        intake by one cup a day may lower your risk of type 2 diabetes by more than 10 percent. But
                        what you add to the coffee matters too. Avoid adding too much sugar, syrups, and milk to
                        your coffee</p>
                    </div>

                        <h2> Nuts</h2>
                        Nuts contain unsaturated fats, proteins and a range of vitamins and minerals that lower
                        cholesterol, inflammation and insulin resistance. According to a study, you should include
                        at least 50 grams of almonds, cashews, chestnuts, walnuts or pistachios in your daily diet
                        to control high levels of blood fats (triglycerides) and sugars.

                        <h2> Banana</h2>
                        Accordingly, to a study done by the University College Dublin in Ireland, resistant starch found
                        in foods such as bananas, potatoes, grains and legumes, may benefit your health by aiding blood
                        sugar control, supporting gut health and enhancing satiety. This is a form of starch that is not
                        digested in the small intestine and is, therefore, considered a type of dietary fibre.

                        <h2> Chia seeds</h2>
                        Chia seeds are beneficial and high in fibre and healthy fats, omega-3s, calcium, and
                        antioxidants. Studies have shown that high chia seed diets can help lower LDL cholesterol and
                        triglycerides.

                        Chia seeds have a GI of 1 and are a great addition to recipes. The gooey texture works great as
                        thickener in this pudding recipe from Little Broken (skip the maple syrup). Nutrition Stripped
                        uses chia seeds and cauliflower to make a low-carb pizza crust.

                        <h2>Amla</h2>
                        Amla is the fruit of the Indian gooseberry tree and is a traditional remedy to control high
                        blood sugar levels. It also contains a type of mineral called chromium which regulates
                        carbohydrate metabolism and helps in making your body more responsive to insulin.

                        <h2> Greens</h2>
                        Leafy greens are high in fibre and nutrients like magnesium and vitamin A. These nutrients can
                        help to lower blood sugar.

                        Eating 1.35 servings instead of .2 servings of leafy greens per day is associated with a 14
                        percent reduction of risk for developing type 2 diabetes.

                        <h2> Garlic</h2>
                        Garlic has potential to help manage blood sugar. Reports show garlic intake can lower fasting
                        blood glucose, which is your blood sugar level when you haven’t eaten. Similar studies also
                        suggest that onions have positive effects on blood sugar levels.

                        <h2> Greek Yogurt</h2>
                        Greek yogurt is a great dairy option for diabetics, given its ability to control blood sugar
                        levels and reduce the risk of heart disease. This is partly due to the presence of probiotics in
                        them.

                        Studies have also found that yogurt and other dairy products can result in weight loss and
                        better body composition among people with type 2 diabetes. Greek Yogurt contains fewer carbs
                        than conventional yogurt, while also being richer in protein. The high protein content promotes
                        weight loss by helping one feel full for longer and thus reducing calorie intake
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                        <h2>Flaxseeds</h2>
                        Flaxseeds contain insoluble fiber made up of lignans, which reduces heart disease risk and
                        improves blood sugar control. A study showed that people with type 2 diabetes that consumed
                        flaxseed lignans for 12 weeks experienced a major improvement in hemoglobin A1c.

                        Another study suggested that a higher intake of flaxseed can lower the risk of strokes. Their
                        high viscous fiber content helps improve gut health, insulin sensitivity, and the feeling of
                        fullness in the body.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                        <h2> Apple Cider Vinegar</h2>
                        Although it’s made from apples, the sugar content in the fruit is fermented into acetic acid,
                        with the resulting product containing very few carbs.

                        Apple cider vinegar tends to improve insulin sensitivity and lower fasting blood sugar levels.
                        It can also reduce blood sugar levels by as much as 20% when consumed with meals that contain
                        carbs. One study showed that people with poorly controlled diabetes saw a 6% reduction in
                        fasting blood sugar levels when they had two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar before sleeping.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                        <p>
                        <h2> Strawberries</h2>
                        Strawberries are rich in anthocyanins, the antioxidants that give them their red color. These
                        antioxidants have been shown to reduce insulin and cholesterol levels right after a meal. They
                        also reduce the risk of increased blood sugar levels and heart diseases in type 2 diabetes
                        patients.

                        A single cup of strawberries contains 49 calories and only 11 grams of carbs, 3 of which are
                        fiber. This serving also ensures that one gets more than 100% of their required daily intake of
                        vitamin C, thus providing additional anti-inflammatory benefits for heart health.

                        <h2> cinnamon</h2>
                        Along with its strong antioxidant properties, cinnamon is also known for its ability to
                        control diabetes. According to several controlled studies, cinnamon can help reduce blood
                        sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity as well.

                        Care must be taken to limit your intake of cassia cinnamon to less than a single teaspoon a
                        day. The presence of coumarin in this type of cinnamon has been linked to health problems at
                        higher doses. On the other hand, Ceylon cinnamon does not contain much coumarin.

                        If you don’t have an exercise routine in place, start with walking. “Walking is easy for people
                        to do,” Colberg says, “All you need is a good pair of shoes and somewhere to go. Walking is
                        probably one of the most prescribed activities for people with type 2 diabetes.” Brisk walking
                        done at a pace that raises the heart rate is considered a moderate-intensity exercise, according
                        to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Walking at a quicker clip 30 minutes per day
                        five days per week will help you reach the recommended goal of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity
